# 🐘 PHP

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a powerful, server-side scripting language designed for web development. It is embedded in HTML and widely used to create dynamic web pages. PHP processes code on the server, generating HTML sent to the client's browser. Known for its ease of use, PHP can interact with databases, manage sessions, and handle form data, making it an essential tool for building interactive and data-driven websites.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Apache, PHP, and MySQL
To run PHP on your computer, you need a web server. We recommend using XAMPP because it has everything you need: Apache (the web server), PHP, and MySQL (a database).

#### 🛠️ Installing XAMPP:
1. **Download XAMPP:**
   - Go to the [XAMPP download page](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and download the version for your operating system.
   - ![Download XAMPP](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37245306/87191329-52e0c300-c306-11ea-9e9f-d5f7d7edb7d0.png)
   
2. **Install XAMPP:**
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions. Make sure Apache, MySQL, and PHP are selected.
   - Complete the installation.

3. **Start XAMPP:**
   - Open the XAMPP control panel.
   - Start the Apache and MySQL modules.

### Step 2: Verify PHP Installation
1. **Open your browser:**
   - Go to `http://localhost` to check if Apache is running. You should see the XAMPP dashboard.

2. **Create a PHP file:**
   - Go to the `htdocs` directory inside your XAMPP installation folder.
   - Create a file named `info.php` and add the following code:
     ```php
     <?php
     phpinfo();
     ?>
     ```

3. **Run the PHP file:**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/info.php`. You should see a page with PHP configuration details, which means PHP is working!
